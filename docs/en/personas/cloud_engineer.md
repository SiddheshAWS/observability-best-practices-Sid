## AWS Cost Management üí∏

**Goal:** Optimize your AWS costs by monitoring and controlling your spending.

| Level | Category                | Description                                                        | Tips & Examples                                               | Additional Notes                    |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Basic** | Track Your Spending       | Set up dashboards to monitor how your business activities impact costs | **Example:** Monitor marketing campaigns' effect on server costs | **Pro Tip:** Start with basic daily cost tracking<br>‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfall:** Failing to set up alerts |
| **Basic** | Budget Management         | Use AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to detect and act on unexpected charges | **Tip:** Focus on setting budgets for each department or service | Establish clear budget placements |
| **Intermediate** | Resource Tagging         | Implement resource tagging to track resource usage by teams and projects | **Quick Win:** Start with these 3 tags: <br>1. Project<br>2. Environment<br>3. Owner | **Did You Know?** You could save 20-30% after implementing tagging |
| **Intermediate** | Cost & Usage Dashboards   | Use CORA implementation to gain enhanced visibility into cost levels | Set up granular cost dashboards for better tracking |                                 |
| **Advanced** | Cost Automation            | Automate shutting down unused resources to save on costs | **Example:** Power off non-production servers during off hours | **Pro Tip:** Begin with non-production environments |
| **Advanced** | Strategic Implementation   | Establish KPIs and implement FinOps Foundation principles | Create cost optimization KPIs and track them over time |                                 |

### Recommendations:
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic monitoring and expand to more advanced techniques as you become more comfortable with AWS tools.
- **Use tags effectively**: Tagging is one of the most powerful ways to track and allocate costs. Implementing it early can save significant time in the future.

## AWS Performance & Availability üöÄ

**Goal:** Ensure optimal performance and availability of your AWS-hosted applications.

| Level | Component              | Description                                                        | Tips & Examples                                               | Additional Notes                    |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Basic** | Watch Your Apps          | Monitor app performance from different locations using tools like AWS Compute Optimizer | **Example:** Check if users in different regions experience delays | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfall:** Monitoring from only a single location |
| **Intermediate** | Track Connection Points  | Monitor how different parts of your application communicate with each other | **Quick Win:** Start by tracking the performance of your most critical service | **Did You Know?** Most outages happen due to service-to-service communication failures |
| **Advanced** | Application Signals      | Implement RUM (Real User Monitoring) and Synthetic Monitoring | Use for real-time monitoring and quick troubleshooting |                                   |

### Recommendations:
- **Understand user experience**: Monitoring only server-side metrics isn't enough. Be sure to track actual user experience globally.
- **Prioritize key services**: Begin monitoring your most critical application components and scale monitoring from there.

## AWS Security Monitoring üîí

**Goal:** Secure your AWS infrastructure by monitoring for security vulnerabilities and incidents.

| Level | Component              | Description                                                        | Tips & Examples                                               | Additional Notes                    |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Basic** | Central Security Monitoring | Consolidate all security logs in one central place for easy access and analysis | **Example:** Track all access to sensitive data and resources | **Pro Tip:** Start by focusing on login attempts and access patterns |
| **Intermediate** | Configuration Management  | Keep track of configuration states and vulnerabilities through automation | **Implementation:** Automate configuration audits using AWS Systems Manager (SSM) |                                    |
| **Advanced** | Change Monitoring          | Track changes to critical settings, users, and roles | **Quick Win:** Set up alerts for unexpected login patterns or access changes | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfall:** Overlooking who has admin access |

### Recommendations:
- **Prioritize security**: Security should never be an afterthought. Start with basic monitoring and progress to more sophisticated configurations.
- **Automate alerts**: Setting up automatic alerts for unusual activities helps detect potential threats before they escalate.

## User Experience Monitoring üìà

**Goal:** Optimize user experience by monitoring application usage, speed, and behavior.

| Level | Component              | Description                                                        | Tips & Examples                                               | Additional Notes                    |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
