# Observability Best Practices

## Welcome

This is the source for the [AWS Observability Best Practices site](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/). Everyone is welcome to contribute here, not just AWS employees!

## How to run/develop this site

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
You need to install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) as a prerequisite.

### Installation

```
cd docusaurus
$ (yarn | npm ) install
```

### Local Development

Build
```
$ yarn build [or] npm run build
```

Start
```
$ yarn start [or] npm run start
```

japanese i18n server
```
$ yarn start -l ja [or] npm run start -l ja
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Contribute
Ensure that the build is succeeding without any broken links
```
$ yarn build [or] npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH with yarn:
```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy 
```

Using SSH with npm:
```
$ USE_SSH=true  npm run serve
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
