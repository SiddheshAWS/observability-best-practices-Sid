## AWS Cost Management ðŸ’¸

**Goal:** Optimize your AWS costs by monitoring and controlling your spending.

| Level | Category                | Description                                                        | Tips & Examples                                               | Additional Notes                    |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Basic** | [Track Your Spending](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/guides/cost/cost-visualization/cost)       | Set up dashboards to monitor how your business activities impact costs | **Example:** Monitor marketing campaigns' effect on server costs | **Pro Tip:** Start with basic daily cost tracking  
**Common Pitfall:** Failing to set up alerts |
| **Basic** | [Budget Management](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/guides/operational/business/key-performance-indicators)         | Establish spenditure limits to measure project costs | **Tip:** Focus on setting budgets for each department or service | **Recommendation:** Establish clear budget placements |
| **Intermediate** | [Resource Tagging](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/recipes/recipes/metrics-explorer-filter-by-tags)         | Implement resource tagging to track resource usage by teams and projects | **Quick Win:** Start with these 3 tags:  
1. Project  
2. Environment  
3. Owner | **Did You Know?** You could save 20-30% after implementing tagging |
| **Intermediate** | [Cost & Usage Visibility](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/guides/cost/cost-visualization/cost)   | Ensure that you are only incurring the costs you need and that you are not overspending on resources you don't need | **Example:** Set up granular cost dashboards for better tracking | **Pro Tip:** Take into consideration the different [cost optimization tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-laying-the-foundation/reporting-cost-optimization-tools.html) AWS provides                                 |
| **Advanced** | [Smart Cost Management](https://community.aws/content/2muS34cXUidGfdzpd5EkpCcphLc/aws-serverless-how-to-stop-ec2-using-event-bridge-and-lambda)            | Automate tasks that will limit unnecesary spenditure | **Example:** Power off non-production servers during off hours | **Pro Tip:** Begin with non-production environments |
| **Advanced** | [Strategic Implementation](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/guides/operational/business/key-performance-indicators)   | Establish KPIs and implement FinOps Foundation principles | Create cost optimization KPIs and track them over time | **Pro Tip:** Start with the "Unit Economics" KPI - measure your cost per business output (e.g., cost per transaction, cost per customer, or cost per service).  

**Did you know?** Remember: The best KPIs are those that directly tie cloud spending to business outcomes, making it easier to demonstrate ROI and gain buy-in for FinOps initiatives. |

### Recommendations:
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic monitoring and expand to more advanced techniques as you become more comfortable with AWS tools.
- **Use tags effectively**: Tagging is one of the most powerful ways to track and allocate costs. Implementing it early can save significant time in the future.
